## Hello, I'm Frida 👋

For the past 5 years, I've been developing data-backed solutions for non-profits, universities, and companies. These solutions have improved urban park restoration, increased grant funding acquisitions for non-profits, and bolstered research publishing, to name a few.

**Software**: PowerBI, Tableau, GIS (*ArcGIS, ArcGIS Online, QGIS*)

**Languages**: SQL, R, Python, HTML, JavaScript, CSS
