## Hello, I'm Frida 👋

For the past 5 years, I've been developing data-backed solutions for non-profits, universities, and companies. These solutions have solved many pressing issues, including improved urban park restoration, increased grant funding acquisitions, and bolstered research publishing.

**Software**: PowerBI, Tableau, GIS (*ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Online, QGIS*)

**Languages**: SQL, R, Python, HTML, JavaScript, CSS

| Project | Description | Tools |
| --- | :--- | :--- |
| [Web Map: Route Planner](https://github.com/fkitz/route-planning-web-map) | My goal for my first website was to build a simple web map for a specific audience. Pathfinder is a route planning application aimed at pedestrians and runners. It showcases my ability to develop a web map and utilize HTML for a targeted audience. | VS Code, ArcGIS JS API, HTML, JS, CSS |
| [Country Guessing Game](https://github.com/fkitz/country-guessing-game) | This guessing game allows the user to guess the country 10 times, using direction-based hints to assist. This project showcases my ability to use Python for data cleaning, file reading and writing, and modular code development. | Python, VS Code |
| [Custom Spatial Buffer](https://github.com/fkitz/custom-arcgis-buffer) | The purpose of this script is to build a custom spatial buffer that allows for only one input, while creating multiple buffered outputs. It showacases my ability to develop Python scripts to customize geoprocessing tools. | Python, VS Code, ArcGIS Pro |
| [ArcGIS Enumeration Tool](https://github.com/fkitz/arcgis-enumeration-tool) | This tool is designed to summarize the number of feature classes by type (point, line, polygon) within a spatial workspace. It displays my ability to create Python scripts for ArcGIS Pro, and how to integrate custom messages. | Python, VS Code, ArcGIS Pro |
