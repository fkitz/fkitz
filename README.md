| Project | Description | Tools |
| --- | :--- | :--- |
| [Web Map: Route Planner](https://github.com/fkitz/route-planning-web-map/tree/main) | My goal for my first web map was to build a simple web map for a specific audience. Pathfinder is a route planning application aimed at pedestrians and runners. It showcases my ability to develop a web map and utilize HTML for a targeted audience. | VS Code, ArcGIS JS API, HTML, JS, CSS |
| [Country Guessing Game](https://github.com/fkitz/country-guessing-game/tree/main) | This guessing game allows the user to guess the country 10 times, using direction-based hints to assist. This project showcases my ability to use Python for data cleaning, file reading and writing, and modular code development. | Python, VS Code |
